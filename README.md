# March for Gaza – A Visual Representation

This project is a **Computer Graphics Lab** work visualizing the **Gaza Mass Genocide** using **OpenGL GLUT in C++**. It consists of three powerful static images representing the destruction of Gaza, the identity of the Palestinian people, and the global solidarity movement.

> 🕊️ **"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free."**

## 📷 Project Overview

The project contains **three visual scenes**:
1. **Scene 1 – GAZA Text with Blood:**  
   A symbolic representation of the word "GAZA" with blood dripping and scattered blood in the background.

2. **Scene 2 – Destroyed City of Gaza:**  
   Shows broken buildings, burnt vehicles, and smoke—symbolizing brutal destruction by Israeli airstrikes.

3. **Scene 3 – Palestine Map and Flag:**  
   Displays the red map of Palestine, the green Gaza Strip, the flag of Palestine, and the slogan:  
   *"From the river, to the sea, Palestine will be free."*
